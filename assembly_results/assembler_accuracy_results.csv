Nb = Number of bases (total no. bases in assembly) = AlignedBases = Total number of bases contained within an alignment,,,,,,,,,
"Nc = Number of contigs (Total number of segments in the assembly) = Alignments 1-1 = Number of alignment blocks comprising the 1-to-1 mapping of reference to query. This is a subset of the M-to-M mapping, with repeats removed",,,,,,,,
I% = AvgIdentity 1-1 = Percentage similarity between the assembly and the reference genome = Average identity of 1-to-1 alignment blocks between the assembly and reference,,,,,,,,,
C% = AlignedBases % (reference) = Ratio of the number of aligned bases in the reference genome to the length of the reference genome,,,,,,,,,
NM = Total number of single-base differences between the assembly and the reference genome = TotalSNPs,,,,,,,,,
NI = Total number of insertions and deletions between the assembly and the reference genome = TotalIndels,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
N.b results for monomicrobial samples exclude one sample as the sequencing data was too large meaning job exceeded HPC's max runtime of 7 days (timed out). Results are an average across the remaining 4 monomicrobial samples,,,,,,,,,
N.b. timed out = 'job exceede HPC's max runtime of 7 days',,,,,,,,,
